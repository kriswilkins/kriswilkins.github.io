            <h1>SayWhat</h1>
            <p>SayWhat is a multi-platform, multi-media translation application developed as a capstone project for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. Created collaboratively with two other developers over a three-month period, the application successfully delivers comprehensive translation capabilities across multiple formats: <br>
                &bull; Live recorded audio translation with speech output
                &bull; Text extraction and translation from both live-captured and stored photos
                &bull; Live typed text translation
                &bull; Desktop Mode enabling real-time audio-to-text translation between two users in their 
                preferred languages<br>
                The project demonstrates strong technical implementation skills through various API integrations and cross-platform development, resulting in a fully functional mobile application compatible with both Android and iOS. The development process required significant time management, research, and collaborative teamwork to successfully deliver this versatile translation solution within the three-month timeframe.
            
                Here's a walkthrough video of the application.<br>

            <h1>Mental Health Chatbot</h1>
            <p>I developed a Mental Health Chatbot LLM as an independent one-month project using the chatterbot Python library. I trained the bot on a comprehensive dataset obtained from Huggingface with the purpose of creating a chatbot that could provide encouraging advice to users struggling with their mental health, while recommending professional help when deemed necessary.
                <br>During development, I faced several challenges including:<br>
                &bull;Finding a large enough dataset for training the model
                &bull;Cleaning the data multiple times to reduce hallucinations in responses
                &bull;Building a web-based user interface for the first time
                &bull;Successfully deploying the web application on Heroku
                &bull;Completing all aspects of the project within a limited one-month timeframe<br>
                Overall, this project was a significant challenge that I look back on fondly. It allowed me to combine my technical skills in machine learning, data processing, and web development while creating a solution with potential positive impact on users' wellbeing.<br>
                Here is a video of some Think Aloud testing that was performed during the development process.<br>

            <h1>Whisay</h1>
            <p>I independently developed Whisay, focusing on building my own Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to extract and translate text from images.
                I completed this project within the challenging timeframe of just one week.<br>
                The application performed well when processing stored images but faced challenges with live-captured photos. To test the mobile functionality, I deployed the web application on Heroku to enable testing from my mobile device. However, I discovered that images were being compressed during transmission, which reduced the OCR system's ability to accurately recognize characters.<br>
                The primary challenge for this project was the tight one-week time constraint, which prevented me from resolving the live-capture functionality issues. Despite this limitation, I was impressed with how much functionality I was able to implement in such a short period, successfully creating a working OCR system that could effectively process and translate text from stored images.<br>
                Here is an example of how the application works. It has been simplified to run as a client-side application on this website. Upload an image containing text in a language other than English, and the application will translate it into English for you and read it aloud.<br>
            </p>
            <!-- Upload Image -->
            <div class="input-container">
                <input type="file" id="image-upload" accept="image/*">
                <button onclick="processImage()">Extract & Translate</button>
            </div>

            <!-- Extracted & Translated Text Sections -->
            <div class="text-container">
                <p><strong>Extracted Text:</strong> <span id="extracted-text"></span></p>
                <p><strong>Translated Text:</strong> <span id="translated-text"></span></p>
            </div>

            <!-- Read Aloud & Stop Playback Buttons -->
            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="speakText()">Read Aloud</button>
                <button onclick="stopSpeech()">Stop Playback</button>
